                <p class="fst-italic">
                    Students must learn to operate on their own, and take responsibility for themselves.  It is important for students to find emotional and instrumental independence.  Emotional independence means the ability of a student to willingly risk relationships of those who are close to them in exchange for pursuing their own individual interests or convictions.  Instrumental independence is the ability to solve problems on one's own.  Through this vector, students can manage the tensions between the need for independence and the need for acceptance, along with respecting the uniqueness and independence of others.

This exposure can help students gain such tolerance of unique differences.   Intimacy refers to the ability to establish relationships that are close and meaningful.

                <p class="fst-italic">
                    "Development of identity is the process of discovering with what kinds of experience, at what levels of intensity and frequency, we resonate in satisfying, in safe, or in self-destructive fashion," argues Chickering.  This development establishes how an individual is perceived by others.  Ultimately, the formation of one's identity leads to a sense of contentment with one's self and how that self is seen by others.

                <p class="fst-italic">
                    This vector is closely related to the previous one, as it is the ability for students to personalize humanizing values, and apply them to their own behavior.  Many values that students bring with them to college are challenged in this environment.  The establishment of integrity is the ability for students to assemble and practice the values that are actually consistent with their own beliefs.
